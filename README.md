## AirBnB Clone Project
This project is a Python implementation of a command-line interface similar to Airbnb's functionalities.

## Command Interpreter
The project includes a command interpreter named console.py. This script allows users to interact with the application and execute various commands.

## Starting the Interpreter:

# There are two ways to interact with the interpreter:

  Interactive Mode:

  Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing console.py.
  Run the script using the following command:
  
    Bash
    ./console.py
    
  Use code with caution.
  This will launch the interpreter in an interactive mode, displaying a prompt like (hbnb). You can then enter commands and receive responses.

  Non-Interactive Mode:

  You can pipe commands through the interpreter using echo:
  
    Bash
    echo "help" | ./console.py

  Use code with caution.
  This will display the help message without entering the interactive mode.

  Using the Interpreter:

  The interpreter provides various commands for interacting with the Airbnb-like application.

  To see a list of available commands, type help:

    (hbnb) help
    
  For detailed information on a specific command, use help <command_name>:

    (hbnb) help quit
    
  Examples:

  Get help on available commands:

    (hbnb) help
    
  Exit the interpreter:

    (hbnb) quit
    
  Get help on the quit command in non-interactive mode:

    Bash
    echo "help quit" | ./console.py
    
  Use code with caution.
  
Note: Specific functionalities and available commands will be added as the project progresses. Refer to the code and future updates to this file for a complete list.
